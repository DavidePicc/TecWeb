# Repo of the 2024 web technology project.

Saudade  is  a  website  created  for  a  fictional  company  that  allows  you  to  purchase  “dreams”  as  if  they  were  movies  or  TV  series,  to  be  used  with  the  neural  chip  created  by  the  company. In  addition  to  dreams,  it  is  possible  to  book  an  appointment  to  implant  the  chip,  the  style  of  the  site  is  a  mix  between  a  classic  e-commerce  and  a  review  site,  such  as  'rottentomatoes.com',  where  you  can  leave  and  consult  reviews  on  a  particular  film

## Rules for the Web Technologies Project
The project must be carried out by groups of 4 people.
The submission of the project in the February session (and only for the February session) includes two bonus points, to be added to the grade obtained in the project ONLY if the project is evaluated as sufficient overall (>= 18).
The grade obtained with the submission of the project remains valid for the entire academic year, or until September 30, 2024. The written exam must be passed by the same date.
If the project is evaluated as insufficient or if the grade obtained is not satisfactory, it is necessary to redo the entire project, starting from scratch and without reusing code used in the project already submitted.
In case of suspected copying, the teachers will call the students of the group(s) for an oral exam. In case of refusal, the project is automatically evaluated as insufficient.
The teachers reserve the right to request, at their discretion, additional oral exams from the groups and/or individuals.

## Technical Specifications
- The website must be created with the HTML5 standard. The pages must degrade elegantly and must respect the XML syntax;
- the layout must be created with pure CSS (CSS2 or CSS3);
- The use of Flex and Grid layouts, if developed correctly and used reasonably, are evaluated very positively;
- the website must respect the complete separation between content, presentation and behavior;
- the website must be accessible to all categories of users;
- the website must organize its contents so that they can be easily found by any user;
- the website must contain pages that use PHP scripts to collect and publish data entered by users (the possibility of modifying and deleting the data itself must also be developed);
- among the inputs requested from the user there must be at least one free text field;
- there must be a form of control of the input entered by the user, both client-side and server-side;
- the data entered by users must be saved in a database; 
- it is preferable that the database is in normal form.

The project must be accompanied by a report that illustrates the design, implementation and testing phases and highlights the role played by the individual members of the group.

An initial analysis of the characteristics of the users that the site aims to reach and the possible searches on search engines to which the site must respond is required. Furthermore, the actions taken to improve the site's ranking must be indicated.

Web pages must be accessible regardless of the browser and the screen size of the users' devices. Considerations regarding different devices (where possible) will be evaluated positively.

Failure to comply with even one of these specifications will result in the project not being sufficient.
